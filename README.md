Find the “Email” field. What boundary values would you define (e.g valid email address with the least number of characters possible)? Write 2 examples for each of your answers.
Find the “Telefonszám” field. How many equivalence partitions would you define when testing this field? In case ordered partitions, define their smallest and highest value. In case unordered partitions, give their descriptions about their content.
Find the “Időszak kezdete” and “Időszak vége” fields. Write a minimum of 10 test cases for the combination of these two fields. For each test case indicate which test technique you used.

E-mail field: Boundary values are defined as per the syllabus
Phone number field: ordered and unordered partitions defined
From – to field: EP and BVA used, valid and invalid partitions defined for both; min 10 TCs
